Employee Attrition Prediction
This project predicts employee attrition based on various employee features such as age, department, job satisfaction, and more. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization, allowing HR to take proactive measures to retain employees.
Problem Statement
Employee attrition is a significant concern for many companies, as it can lead to high turnover costs, loss of talent, and reduced productivity. By predicting which employees are likely to leave, organizations can implement retention strategies and improve workforce management.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset, which includes employee demographics, job-related information, and other attributes that may influence employee attrition.
    Source: IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset
    Features:
        Employee age, job role, department, distance from home, education, salary, and other HR-related metrics.
        Target Variable: Attrition (1 for employee left, 0 for employee stayed).
Objective
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave or stay with the company) based on various features.
Methodology
    Data Loading and Preprocessing:
        Load the dataset and drop irrelevant columns (EmployeeCount, EmployeeNumber, Over18, StandardHours).
        Encode categorical features into numerical values using LabelEncoder.
    Train/Test Split:
        Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).
    Feature Scaling:
        Apply standard scaling to normalize the features for better model performance.
    Model Building:
        Train a Random Forest Classifier model on the training data.
    Model Evaluation:
        Evaluate the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
    Visualization:
        Display a heatmap of the confusion matrix to assess the model's performance visually.
Libraries Used
    pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization.
    sklearn: Machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.
Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
How to Run
    Download the IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset from Kaggle.
    Place the dataset file (e.g., 6. Predict Employee Attrition.csv) in the same directory as the script.
    Run the Python script.
Results
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) to assess how well it predicts employee attrition. A confusion matrix heatmap is also generated to visualize the model's true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Future Improvements
    Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
    Experiment with other models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) for better accuracy.
    Address class imbalance issues (if any) using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
