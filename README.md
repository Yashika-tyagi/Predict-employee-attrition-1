📊 Predict Employee Attrition.

This project uses machine learning to predict employee attrition, helping organizations identify individuals who may be at risk of leaving. By leveraging historical HR data, we aim to improve retention strategies and support data-driven decision-making.
🚀 Project Overview

Objective:
Predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on factors such as job satisfaction, performance, salary, work-life balance, and more.

Key Features:

    Data preprocessing and feature engineering

    Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

    Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

    Model evaluation and comparison

    Predictive dashboard or API integration (optional)

📌 Dataset Source: Kaggle HR Analytics
🧠 Models Used

    Logistic Regression

    Decision Tree

    Random Forest

    Gradient Boosting / XGBoost

    Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model performance is evaluated using:

    Accuracy

    Precision, Recall, F1 Score

    ROC-AUC Curve

    Confusion Matrix

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Language: Python

    Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, xgboost

    Optional: Streamlit / Flask for web interface

📈 Results

    Achieved accuracy of ~XX% (varies by model)

    Top features contributing to attrition include: Job Satisfaction, Monthly Income, Years at Company, etc.
